# [Counting Graphs](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/counting-graphs_8357237)

**Problem statement**

Return the number of undirected graphs that can be formed using 'N' vertices, allowing for disconnected components within the graph. Self-edges and multiple edges are not allowed.



For Example: <br>
For N = 2, <br>
Count is 2. <br>
Consider the vertices to be ‘A’ and ‘B’. <br>
These are the possible 2 graphs.
